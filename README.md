--------------SUPERCHARGED MATHEMATICAL TYPING LUASNIP SNIPPETS--------------<br />
A handful of snippets crafted to type LaTeX documents fast.<br />

If you have no idea how anything of the above works, see :https://ejmastnak.com/tutorials/vim-latex/intro/<br />
This project uses the neovim plugin Luasnip: https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip<br />
You might also want to have Vimtex installed and configured:https://github.com/lervag/vimtex<br />

NOTE: Some of the snippets are defined to work with the latex definitions found in "boilerplates.lua". <br />
If you use these snippets and the definition is missing in the preamble of the document, it will not compile.
