- DONE Fix brackets (rb, sb, etc.)
- DONE try: "gat, gatn" Gather environments
- DONE try: "bra, ket, brk" braket notation for QM
- DONE try: "neq" Not equal sign
- DONE try: "ee" Exp function shortcut Lists
- DONE try: "hb" hbar?
- DONE try: ";O, ;o"Theta symbol? 
- DONE Changed exponent operator from su to du. Sum conflicts with su.
- DONE Trig functions
- DONE package babel Package to use symbols with accent in math mode (for typingig in German/ Spanish)
- DONE try: "ab" (angle brackets) <> bracket environment (for time averages over time). 
- DONE try: "deg" Degree symbol
- DONE try "prop" Proportional to symbol
- DONE try: "la,ra,La,Ra"Normal arrow (like in limits)

- DONE try: "boxed"add boxes (box environment to contain equations)
- DONE try: "txt" Text environment snippet (for writing text inside a math environment). 
- DONE Symbols to show about/ approximately.
- DONE Much greater than/ much less than (<< and >>)
- DONE >= and <=
- DONE "Defined as" symbol (equal sign with three lines) 
- DONE ^2 and ^3 shortcuts as well as d^2 x/ d x^2 snippit and par^2 x/ par t^2 snippits
- DONE +/- symbol
- DONE Subsections
- DONE 3x1, 4x1 Matrices
- DONE 1x3, 1x4 Matrices
- DONE Logarithms
- DONE Must be equal to symbol

- Other conflicts (commented out)
- Units
- Image insertion and management? 
- Multi-line boxes.
- Itemize, enumerate, and item snippits. 
- Unit matrices (work in progress)
- Fix spacing of environments to be one tab (see 'fla' snippet as example).
- Reorganize files (especially math operators)
- Reference variables instead of declaring them in each file.
- Double and triple integral snippits for surfaces and volumes (integrals of multiple variables, such as when integrating a volume in spherical coordinates). 
- Scientific notation snippit
- Horizontal line (hrule)
- Create snippits for ^0 and ^1 and fix ^2 and ^3 to be more intuitive (perhaps similar to _0, _1, _2, _3, etc. 
- Boilerplate for lecture notes
- Up and down arrow for spins
- Inner product (Circle with 'times' symbol inside)
